      <p class = "ti">closing remarks from the author</p>
      <div><p class = "subti"><img src = "https://cdn.glitch.com/26fb3820-87d7-4dde-b75d-21d44baef9ab%2Fezgif-3-6927a7554086.gif?1550425650637" class = "hita"/>congratulations. you made it through the puzzles (if you can even call them that). in doing so, you have shown your creativity and ability to, as my seventh-grade math teacher always said, "think outside of the triangle".</p></div>
      <div><p class = "subti"><img src = "https://cdn.glitch.com/26fb3820-87d7-4dde-b75d-21d44baef9ab%2Fezgif-3-a92f2e34d1a3.gif?1550426537184" class = "mun"/>some might say that mezclo ramo is "weird", "stupid", or "nonsensical". i very much disagree. mezclo ramo is simply a playground in every sense of the word.</p></div>
      <p class = "subti">as young children, we often took for granted how incredibly vast our imaginations were. imaginary friends waltzed around the hallways, a dinosaur ate a spiderman action figure, robots could shoot lasers and take over the world.</p>
      <p class = "subti">all of this imagination culminated in that most lively gathering spot, the playground.</p>
      <p class = "subti">the purpose of mezclo ramo is to neither make sense nor refuse to make sense; rather, it is intended to bring the player back to the playground of old, where the rules were yours to make.</p>
      <p class = "subti">as it is, i hope you find your playground. i hope you are able to recreate the environment of your childhood.</p>
      <p class = "subti">take care!</p>
      <p class = "subti">p.s.: have you found these tricks built into mezclo ramo? here are some hints!</p>
      <p class = "subti">have you tried: </p>
      <p class = "subti">- clicking the bat in the night?</p>
      <p class = "subti">- choosing the wrong answer on the test?</p>
      <p class = "subti">- clicking words besides "fishy" on the fish page?</p>
      <p class = "subti">- dragging the words "what if" into the eyeball in my mind?</p>
      <p class = "subti">- turning on your volume?</p>
